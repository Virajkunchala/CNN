The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items, with 10 different classes,
each corresponding to a different type of clothing item (e.g., T-shirts, pants, dresses, etc.). When using this dataset in Keras,
you typically need to preprocess the data and reshape it into the format expected by your model.

Suppose you are building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the Fashion-MNIST images into their respective classes.
Your model would likely start with a convolutional layer,
