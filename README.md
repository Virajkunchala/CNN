This repository contains a CNN implementation for classifying the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of clothing items belonging to 10 different classes. The model is built using Keras, and it begins with a convolutional layer that applies filters to the input images to extract features. The output of the convolutional layer is passed through a ReLU activation function, and then through a pooling layer to downsample the feature maps. This process is repeated several times, with additional convolutional and pooling layers added as needed to extract higher-level features from the images. The resulting feature maps are flattened and passed through fully connected layers, which learn to classify the images based on the extracted features. Finally, a softmax activation function is applied to the output layer to produce probability scores for each class. The model is trained and evaluated on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and techniques such as dropout regularization and batch normalization are applied to improve performance.
